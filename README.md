# todo-list
while building this application i learnt the basic concepts of react.
i learnt how react functinos when the state of a component changes, the program reacts to the state change leading to the functioning of the program.
i understood how we divide different elements of the program and into components and then establish a logical mapping amognst them in order to achieve proper functioning and logical presentation of the data according to our requirements.
different methods and invoked when a certain state change takes place and re-evaluated the state of each component affected by that particular method invocation and stores the data for further application.
